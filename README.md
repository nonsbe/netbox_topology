# netbox_topology

Patch to apply to a netbox installation to add beautiful topology view to sites

**Updated to use `/api/dcim/cables/ endpoint instead` of `/api/dcim/interface-connections/`**

Once installed your individual site's pages should look like this:

5. modify `$NETBOXPATH/netbox/static/js/topology_config.json` to include your list on roles to hide from the topology view. You will need to add new list of cables to shown under `shown_cables`. Constants are [defined here](https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox/blob/develop/netbox/dcim/constants.py#L336)
```
CABLE_TYPE_CAT3 = 1300
CABLE_TYPE_CAT5 = 1500
CABLE_TYPE_CAT5E = 1510
CABLE_TYPE_CAT6 = 1600
CABLE_TYPE_CAT6A = 1610
CABLE_TYPE_CAT7 = 1700
CABLE_TYPE_MMF_OM1 = 3010
CABLE_TYPE_MMF_OM2 = 3020
CABLE_TYPE_MMF_OM3 = 3030
CABLE_TYPE_MMF_OM4 = 3040
CABLE_TYPE_SMF = 3500
CABLE_TYPE_POWER = 5000
``` 

*please note that the list should include SLUGs for roles, not names and number for the cables to be shown. please check that json is valid.*
